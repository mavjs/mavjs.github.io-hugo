# What is Atomic Red Team?
> Atomic Red Team&trade; is a library of simple tests mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK&reg; framework that every security team can execute to test their defenses. Tests are focused, have few dependencies, and are defined in a structured format that can be used by automation frameworks.[^1] - RedCanaryCo

Atomic Red Team is the main testing repository in the Atomic Family, first created by the esteemed folks from Red Canary.[^2] The Atomic Family also provides a couple of utility tools to help execute the tests, namely:
* Invoke-AtomicRedTeam - A PowerShell-based framework for developing and executing atomic tests.[^3]
* AtomicTestHarnesses - A PowerShell module for executing many variations of an attack technique at once.[^4]
* Chain Reactor - A tool for testing detection and response coverage on Linux machines.[^5]

In this post we will only talk about Atomic Red Team - the library of tests & `Invoke-AtomicRedTeam` - the powershell framework to run the tests.

# Lab Overview
{{< figure src="/img/lab-example.png" >}}
* pfSense acts as the router and the firewall - rules are set to disallow communication with the Internet, unless explicitly allowed.
* Windows Server Domain Controller provides DHCP and DNS for internal domain.
* RHEL 8 server running Splunk 8 - for centralised logging.
* Fedora 34 client as administrator workstation - allowed to connect to the Internet. Main test execution management platform.
* Windows 10 client - main test execution host.
{{% alert note %}}
We used an existing lab we built, which is closed off of from the Internet, so that may not be the most convenient setup as Atomic Red Team downloads certain scripts from the repo for execution, thus not all tests might run properly.

# Setting up pre-requisites
To execute tests remotely from a Linux machine (which we did here), it requires PowerShell core to be installed.[^6]

## Setting up openssh remoting
We could also use OpenSSH[^7] remoting feature now built-in to Windows. This feature is available in:
* Windows 10
* Windows Server 2019
* Windows Server 2022

Steps to enable:
* Right-click Windows Icon
* Click `Settings`
* Select `Apps > Apps & Features > Optional Features`
* Find `OpenSSH Server`
* Click `Install`

To connect to the machine, execute:
```bash

$ ssh username@machine-ip

```

{{% alert note %}}
We noticed that if we have a machine that is joined to a domain (otherthan `WORKGROUP`), the way you connect is slightly different. Like so:
```bash
$ ssh domain\\username@machine-ip
```
{{% /alert %}}


## PSWSMan module for WinRM PSRemoting on Linux
{{% alert warning %}}
We ended up using WinRM remoting as we encountered a problem with using the SSH remoting feature. It may have something to do with passing in the domain with the username and `New-PSSession` not being happy about it.
Although, it works if using plain old `ssh` command as seen above.
{{% /alert %}}
To use WinRM remoting feature on Linux, we need to install `PSWSMan` module.[^8]

To do so:
```bash
$ sudo pwsh -Command "Install-Module -Name PSWSMan"
$ sudo pwsh -Command "Install-WSMan"
```

Once this is out of our way, we could create a session variable in a PowerShell instance that points to our test execution machine, and start the Atomic Red Team tests.
```powershell

  # Setting a session in PowerShell
  PS> $sess = New-PSSession -ComputerName testexecutionmachine -Credentials domain\username

```
{{% alert note %}}
If SSH remoting worked, we could create the session as follows:
```powershell
  PS> $sess = New-PSSession -HostName testexecutionmachine -UserName username
```
{{% /alert %}}

# Test Execution - the real deal
First install the Execution Framework (`Invoke-AtomicTest`) and Atomics folder on the test execution management platform:
```powershell

  IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/install-atomicredteam.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);
  Install-AtomicRedTeam -getAtomics

```
{{% alert note %}}
The imported `Invoke-AtomicTest` module will live as long as the current PowerShell session is alive. If we want to load the module on startup, we will need to set that in the [PowerShell profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles).
{{% /alert %}}
Once installed, we are ready to rock-n-roll.

{{% alert warning %}}
The screenshots below are made on a Windows machine, as PowerShell does not seem to display all info when calling via `-ShowDetails` argument on a Linux machine.
{{% /alert %}}
However, here are a few commands to check out the library contents:
```powershell

  PS> Invoke-AtomicTest All -ShowDetailsBrief

```
{{< figure src="/img/invoke-atomictest-example1.png" >}}

Say we wanted to know full details of all the tests related to **T1003 - OS Credential Dumping**[^9], we can do:
```powershell

  PS> Invoke-AtomicTest T1003 -ShowDetails

```
{{< figure src="/img/invoke-atomictest-example2.png" >}}

From the details above, we can see that there are multiple test cases associated with **T1003**, and it also notes the dependencies for running the test. So let's get the dependency for test number #2 - Credential Dumping with NPPSpy.
```powershell

  PS> Invoke-AtomicTest T1003 -TestNumbers 2 -GetPrereqs

```
{{< figure src="/img/invoke-atomictest-example3.png" >}}
{{% alert warning %}}
In the above figure, the downloading of the prerequisite dependecy failed, as the machine is not allowed to connect to the Internet.
{{% /alert %}}

After transferring over the dependecy file into `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`, it is finally good to run the test again.
```powershell
  
  # Executing it remotely now
  PS> Invoke-AtomicTest T1003 -Session $sess -TestNumbers 2

```
It will do it's magic in the background, and let us know what we need to do next:
{{< figure src="/img/invoke-atomictest-example4.png" >}}

As recommended, we logged out and logged back in, and voil√†! Credentials were dumped:
{{< figure src="/img/invoke-atomictest-example5.png" >}}

If we are done with the test and want to clean it up, there is also an argument to do so:
```powershell

  PS> Invoke-AtomicTest T1003 -Session $sess -TestNumbers 2 -Cleanp

```
Once the clean-up command runs, it will delete the file with credentials at `C:\NPPSpy.txt` and the dll which was copied to `C:\Windows\System32\NPPSpy.dll`:
{{< figure src="/img/invoke-atomictest-example6.png" >}}

# Summary
If it were not for our roundabout way of doing things and just running it on a single VM setup with Internet access allowed, it should have been a bit more smooth sailing.
However, all in all, the easy of use combined with the curated list of dependencies needed to accomplish a test is a huge win.

There are not a lot of technologies involved in setting it up either, just copy and paste the commands in the wiki and off we go.

Next post(s) we will go through a few attack scenarios that require running multiple steps of tests based on Threat Intel report(s), run the tests that correponds to them and understand what the logs tell us.
