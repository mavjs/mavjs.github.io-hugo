Ever since I read the [Automate backups with restic and systemd](https://fedoramagazine.org/automate-backups-with-restic-and-systemd/) on [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org), I have been meaning to practice the `3-2-1` backup strategy.

For a while, that did not come to fruition. Ultimately, that was down to laziness first of all; secondly, figuring out how and where the backups should be was also another struggle.

However, I finally sat down one weekend and figured out the works.

## What is the `3-2-1` backup strategy?
The `3-2-1` strategy boils down to[^0]:
* **3** copies of data
* **2** different media
* **1** copy being off-site

The tutorial in the Fedora Magazine showcased how one can use `restic`[^1] and trigger the backup periodically via a systemd service unit file, instead of using cron. This also gave me the opportunity to learn a bit more about creating systemd service and timer units, so I decided to follow this.

However, the tutorial made use of an offsite backup solution provided by [BackBlaze B2 Cloud storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html). That solution was not one I was comfortable using just yet.

Mainly due to not wanting to use a service that did not provide Unix/Linux native tools, such as `ssh`, `rsync` and or `sftp` capabilities.

Therefore, I came up with these requirements:
* 1 x local LAN server backup
* 1 x local external drive backup
* 1 x Unix/Linux native tool capable offsite backup

### LAN server backup
This one was pretty easy, I already had a desktop computer which I use as a Virtual Machine host, that was connected via [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) and had a lot of disk space using traditional hard disks.

So all I had to do was initialise a folder on this host via restic using SFTP as described in: https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#sftp

**_Problem #1 solved!_**

### Local drive backup
My laptop is connected to a dock and has a couple of USB-C. I also had a couple of external storage drives, especially the Samsung Portable SSD T7 - 1TB drive.

So all I had to do was make sure that the backup service runs `if and only if` this drive was mounted.

**_Problem #2 solved!_**

In fact, this already in some way, satisfies #1 + #2 of the `3-2-1` strategy.

However, I still needed to make the similar copy backed up offsite. As per my requirements #3, BackBlaze B2 was off the list, sadly. :face_with_head_bandage:

A while back, I read an article titled [Interview with John Kozubkik](https://console.dev/interviews/rsync-john-kozubik/) - John is the CEO of rsync.net which is a cloud storage in the form of a UNIX filesytem available over SSH. Ever since then I have been meaning to use this service somehow.

So for my #3 requirement, I researched using rsync.net and luckily enough, they have a special pricing for restic - https://rsync.net/products/restic.html

Not only that what makes rsync.net interesting is that:
> there is no app or API - it simply gives you an empty UNIX filesystem accessible with any SSH tool. 

P-e-r-f-e-c-t!

So let's piece the things together.

## Systemd service and timer units
Systemd services (ends in `.service`) can be triggered periodically by Systemd timer units (ends in `.timer`). This separates the actual command / script that does the work with the timer configuration. I consider this to be neat!

Furthermore, as pointed out by the great ArchLinux wiki[^2], the benefits are:
* Jobs can be easily started independently of their timers. This simplifies debugging.
* Each job can be configured to run in a specific environment (see systemd.exec(5)).
* Jobs can be attached to cgroups.
* Jobs can be set up to depend on other systemd units.
* Jobs are logged in the systemd journal for easy debugging.

So how would this look like in practice?

Let's say that your backup command is as follows:
```bash
restic backup /home/user/secret-stuff \
    --repo=sftp:backup1-host.rsync.net:backups \
    --verbose \
    --one-file-system \
    --exclude=/home/user/blah 
```

The systemd service file, let's call it, `offsite-backup.service` would be:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Offsite backup with restic

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
ExecStartPre=restic unlock
ExecStart=restic backup /home/user/secret-stuff \
    --repo=sftp:backup1-host.rsync.net:backups \
    --verbose \
    --one-file-system \
    --exclude=/home/user/blah
ExecStopPost=restic unlock
```
The `offsite-backup.timer` would be:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Offsite backup with restic

[Timer]
Oncalendar=daily UTC
Persistent=true
RandomizedDelaySec=300

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Repeat the above steps similarly for different configurations for different backup medium. For example, to backup locally to an external drive `if and only if` it is mounted, I have a service like so:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Local Restic backup service
ConditionPathIsMountPoint=/run/media/user/BackupDriveName/

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
ExecStart=restic backup /home/user/secret-stuff \
    --repo=sftp:backup1-host.rsync.net:backups \
    --verbose \
    --one-file-system \
    --exclude=/home/user/blah
```

If you are running the services for yourself under your own user, you can put them in `~/.config/systemd/user/` folder, otherwise it will have to go into `/etc/systemd/system/` or system-wide user units in `/etc/systemd/user/`.

After that first reload the systemd daemon so that it knows there are new services available.
**Note:** For user services include the `--user` argument after `systemctl`.
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the timer unit:
```bash
systemctl enable --now offsite-backup.timer
```

To check when is the next scheduled run of your service:
```bash
systemctl list-timers
```


:100: :fire: Now you have an automatic backup job that runs according to the schedule you have setup, meaning you can sleep soundly while it does its job. :smile: :tada:
