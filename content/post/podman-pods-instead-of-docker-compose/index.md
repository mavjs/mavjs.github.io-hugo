Nowadays, it is common for developers to provide their (web) application in container for ease of setup. These applications usually consists of multiple inter-connecting parts. For example, the main application interacting with a database to store, read and write data.

To make the experience of setting up databases, developers also provide ways to bring them up automatically. One of the most used and well-known ways of doing this is to provide a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) compose configuration for the application and its required services.

## What is Docker Compose?
> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.[^0]

### How does a Docker Compose configuration look like?
```YAML
version: "3.9"  # optional since v1.27.0
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
      - logvolume01:/var/log
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: redis
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
```
While in the same directory as this configuration file (named: `docker-compose.yaml`), you can bring up these applications by executing:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

When [podman](https://podman.io/) came out, there was a tool created later on called [`podman-compose`](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) to help ease transition from `docker` & `docker-compose`.

## What is Podman?
> Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems.[^1]

As mentioned above, `podman` was easily usable for people already familiar with `docker` without having to re-learn all the command arguments.

I have used `podman-compose` before, however, while looking at an application recently, I wanted to learn to use the more native solution with `podman`. Thus, learning about how I could make use of `podman pod`.

## What is a Pod?
> A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific "logical host": it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. In non-cloud contexts, applications executed on the same physical or virtual machine are analogous to cloud applications executed on the same logical host.
>
> A Pod is similar to a set of containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes.[^2]

Looking again at the example Compose configuration, you will notice that the port from the container `5000` is forwarded to the host's port, i.e., `8000`, meaning ports in Docker are mapped from containers. This is also true for normal containers in Podman as well. However, things work differently in a pod, as stated above about a Pod.

Therefore, for a pod the port is mapped from it, rather than from a container directly. Thus, when you create a pod you also declare the port(s) you want to map to your host.

To understand this better, let's look at the application I used: [miniflux](https://miniflux.app) - a minimalist and opinionated feed reader, to convert their provided [docker installation](https://miniflux.app/docs/installation.html#docker) method in `docker-compose` to using Podman pods.

The Docker compose configuration for miniflux could look like below:
```yaml
version: '3.4'
services:
  miniflux:
    image: miniflux/miniflux:latest
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://miniflux:secret@db/miniflux?sslmode=disable
      - RUN_MIGRATIONS=1
      - CREATE_ADMIN=1
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=test123
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "/usr/bin/miniflux", "-healthcheck", "auto"]
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=miniflux
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
    volumes:
      - miniflux-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "miniflux"]
      interval: 10s
      start_period: 30s
volumes:
  miniflux-db:
```

Breaking it down, you will notice that there are 2 containers:
1. the application: `miniflux/miniflux`
2. the postgres database: `postgres`

This means we will have to pull the 2 images to our local registry:
```bash
$ podman pull ghcr.io/miniflux/miniflux:latest

$ podman pull docker.io/library/postgres:latest
```

The only port mapped is `8080` from the `miniflux` container to port `80` on the host. Therefore, creating a pod would be:
```bash
$ podman pod create --name minifluxapp -p 80:8080
```

You will also notice that the `postgres` container uses a named volume, we will replicate that in podman by:
```bash
$ podman volume create miniflux-db
```

Since the `miniflux` container depends on `db`, we will first create the `db` container inside the pod as follows:
```bash
$ podman run --name=db -d --restart always --pod=minifluxapp \
--volume=miniflux-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
-e POSTGRES_USER=<miniflux-db-admin> \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<miniflux-db-password> \
--health-start-period=30s \
--health-interval=10s \
--health-cmd="CMD-SHELL pg_isready -U miniflux" docker.io/library/postgres:latest
```

Now, the `miniflux` container itself:
```bash
$ podman run --name=miniflux -d --restart=always --pod=minifluxapp \
-e DATABASE_URL=postgres://<db-user>:<db-pass>@localhost/miniflux?sslmode=disable \
-e RUN_MIGRATIONS=1 \
-e CREATE_ADMIN=1 \
-e ADMIN_USERNAME=<admin-user> \
-e ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin-pass> \
--health-cmd="CMD-SHELL /usr/bin/miniflux -healthcheck auto" ghcr.io/miniflux/miniflux:latest
```

If all goes well, your containers should come up inside the pod, and the application is accessible via: `http://127.0.0.1` or `http://localhost`.

From here, you could either generate a kubernetes pod definition[^3] to make it more reusable or systemd unit[^4] files to go together with your system administration.

### pod definition
```bash
$ podman generate kube minifluxapp >> minifluxapp.yaml
```

### systemd units
```bash
$ podman generate systemd \
--container-prefix minifluxapp \
--pod-prefix minifluxpod \
--name minifluxapp
```
