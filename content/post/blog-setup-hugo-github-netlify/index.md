I have had this website / blog (going forward it shall be, _the_ blog) on this current setup since about 2016, it has not always been a smooth ride. Always tinkering, always messing around with it when I do feel like it. However, I have enjoyed writing them.

The oldest post[^0] was first written back in 2011 on blogspot.com (called: **FLOSS Bytes**) , right around the time I got into Linux[^1] and open source communities. However, I wanted to move away from the clunky user interface of blogspot, which also included, as far as I remember, very difficult in themeing. I was also very sold on the idea of a static site generator and hosting my own website, back then.

Finally, the popularity of Jeklly based Github pages and other static site generator tools like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) pushed me to persue that route. The only requirement back then was for the setup to use a static site generator and not a content management system (CMS)[^2].

[^1]: Of course, that also invovled lots of Linux distribution (or as the cool kids say: distro) hopping from Ubuntu to Arch Linux, back to Ubuntu and then finally landing on Fedora since then. :laughing:
