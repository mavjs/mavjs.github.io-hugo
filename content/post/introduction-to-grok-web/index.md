Hey folks, we, the [Fedora Malaysia](http://fedora.my) community in conjunction with UCTI Free & Open Source Software SIG, have planned for an introductory workshop on [Grok](http://grok.zope.org), a web application framework. It uses the [Zope Toolkit (ZTK)](http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit).


This session is aimed towards finding more python as well as zope/plone/FOSS developers  in Malaysia. The session is mentored by our very own [Fedora Ambassador](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors), [Izhar a.k.a KageSenshi](http://blog.kagesenshi.org), who works at a local Plone support and service company called [Inigo Consulting](http://www.inigo-tech.com).

**Following are the details of the session:**

**Date:** Sun 15th July, 2012

**Time:** 11:00-18:00

**Venue:** Level-2 Room-5 (L2-5), UCTI (Google Maps:

**Fee:** Free Of Charge ;)

Folks coming to the session, (that's you!), should bring along their own laptops (obviously!) and do not necessarily need to know [Python](http://python.org), but need to have programming knowledge. Learning/knowing Python can be enhanced later on. Also need to know basic/intermediate HTML/CSS/JS.

Although, we prefer Unix/Linux systems like [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org), users are welcome to use any platform that they wish, provided that they know how to install Grok or any other software packages and troubleshoot problems if they arise.

We might be passing around some Fedora 17 if we happen to not finish them off at Malaysia OpenSource Conference. :P So, if you happen to know how to use \*nix system and just need to boot it up to it, you can use a virtual machine to boot into a \*nix system using the CDs/DVDs passed around or you can also ask me, for an ISO image before the session, if you need one. :)

See you all there!
